- With any of the rendered sequences as well as in the beginning, there will be the option of doing the accurate time estimator
- It will render by required stops

		- can be converted to minutes. 
	- Velocity will take in meters and seconds
		- be convertable to km/hour or mi/hour
	- There will also be a class to take in mi/hour or km/hour and meters 
		and then convert that to total minutes it will take.

RoadTripPlanner
===============

The Road Trip Planner is a web page and application that will instantly tell you whether it is worth it to add extra stops to a road trip. 
	Instead of looking at Google Maps to see the time after adding a destination and then comparing it to the time 
	shown when the destination was not present, this program will automate all those steps. When there are multiple 
	stops, it will calculate the added time from each possible sequence of stops. 

It also has a feature called AccurateTimeEstimator that will calculate the average speed Google thinks you 
	will be going during each step of your trip. It then lets you type in your own speed during that
	step and then it recalculates the time for you. 
	
version1 contains the functionality in unstyled web pages. The multiple stops page only allows 2 stops. In version2, the functionality is all 
	in one page and there is support for up to 8 optional stops. version2 is still in development.
